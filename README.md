Script name:		info.bat

Description:    A basic batch file which, when run, asks for an Active Directory username (i.e. an employee ID number, jsmith, etc...). The returned info shows the employees first and last name, anything in the comments field, when their last password was made and when it will expire, and if their account is locked out.

This script was created using Notepad++.
